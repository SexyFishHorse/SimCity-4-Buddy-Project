Lot Title: PEG Memorial Park Kit (aka.. Drop N' Plop Boneyard)
   Author: Pegasus   ( pegasus@simsite4.com )
  Version: v1.0.6

** Updated to fix a minor prop issue in the Funeral Lot. This error may have prevented the lot from displaying properly on some systems.


The Drop N' Plop Boneyard is now a reality. This kit includes 7 new lots that will allow you to assemble your own Memorial Park. When used with the Scenic Drive Kit, you can construct massive, sprawling memorial parks... or use the pieces individually for small and intimate boneyards wherever you like. "Bring Out Your Dead"... they've got a new home.

This kit includes new custom textures, custom queries and custom sound effects. I especially think you will like the new translucent custom query window. Also keep in mind... this is the basic kit. The 'specialty lots' will soon follow in add-on packs.



** This kit should be compatible with all versions of SC4.

** This kit uses props from the bldgprop_vol1.dat and the Vehicle_Props-V3.dat. However, the required elements have been removed and added to the kit so there are no outside dependencies... other than the game itself.

** Be sure to look for the brain-eating Zombies who get up to stretch their legs every October.



The kit contains the following:


1. A 4x3 Memorial Park Entrance & Mortuary.  (§12,000/§0)
* This is a true Reward Lot and is located in your Rewards menu. It provides all the benefits of a Cemetary Reward and also provides jobs for your entire memorial park. This is the "Key" lot that you will build your large memorial parks around. This lot should be placed on level ground. 

** Includes custom query and sound effect.


2. A 1x1 Memorial Park Wall section. (§50/§2)
* Use this lot to creat a wall around your Memorial Park. It includes the classic cemetary wall section and some basic tombstones. Ideal for keeping grave robbers out... and brain eatting zombies in. This lot must be placed on level ground.

** Suggestion: To build Memorial Parks on hillsides, consider using slope conforming trail parks or the Random Forest to edge your park.


3. A 1x1 Memorial Park Corner Wall section. (§50/§2)
* Similar to the straight wall section but designed for corners.

** 'Inside' corners can be formed using 2 straight wall sections.


4. A 1x1 Tombstone section. (§75/§5)
* A nice variety of tombstones graced by a few trees. This lot is slope conforming and can be used on hillsides.


5. A 1x1 Sarks section. (§75/§5)
* A nice variety of sarks graced by a few trees. This lot is slope conforming and can be used on hillsides.


6. A 1x1 Crypts section. (§75/§5)
* A nice variety of crypts graced by a few trees. This lot is 'semi' slope conforming and can be used on slightly sloped terrain.


7. A 1x2 Funeral Scene section. (§75/§10)
* This brings a little "life" to your park. Its all there... the hearse, the limo, mourners (show up in the afternoon), preacher and, of course, the dearly departed in a lovely floral draped coffin. Be sure to query this lot to hear the lone piper's send off.

** This lot is slope conforming and can be used on hillsides.
